# Intent

**Discord just mandated government ID verification and facial recognition to talk to your friends.**

**Your biometric data. Their servers. Forever. No opt-out.**

We're building the alternative.

## Why Intent Exists

Private communication shouldn't require government surveillance.

Discord crossed the line. Mandatory facial scans and ID uploads aren't security measures—they're a surveillance infrastructure masquerading as safety features.

**Your face isn't a password. Your ID isn't a permission slip to talk to friends.**

Intent exists because the right to private communication is non-negotiable.

---

## What We're Building

A communication platform that respects:

- **Your privacy** - No government IDs, no facial recognition, no biometric harvesting
- **Your resources** - Sub-80MB RAM idle (Discord: 400MB+)
- **Your freedom** - Self-hostable, open clients, verifiable privacy claims
- **Your time** - Sub-100ms voice latency, <10ms message delivery

**Discord without the surveillance, bloat, and closed-source opacity.**

---

## The Vision

Communities are fleeing Discord. Not because they want to—because they have to.

We're not rebuilding Discord. We're building what Discord should have been:

- End-to-end encryption for DMs (MLS protocol)
- WebRTC SFU for high-quality, low-latency voice
- Open-source clients so you can verify privacy claims
- Self-hosting so you control your data
- Bot APIs compatible with Discord patterns (migration should be painless)
- No venture capital pressure to monetize surveillance

**Your server, your rules, your data.**

---

## Current Status

**Phase 1 MVP in active development.**

We're cooking:
- REST API + WebSocket gateway for real-time events
- Voice channels with WebRTC SFU
- Permission system, roles, channels, servers
- Desktop client (Tauri) - lightweight and native
- Bot SDKs (intent.js, intent.py) - discord.js/discord.py compatible
- Discord migration toolkit - server structure import in 5 minutes

**Not ready for daily use yet.** Active development. Heavy iteration.

## Join the Movement

**We need you.**

Discord won't stop at ID verification. The precedent is set. The infrastructure is built. Next comes real-name policies, content scanning, social credit integration.

You can either watch it happen or help build the alternative.

**What we need:**
- **Frontend devs** - Desktop (Tauri), web clients
- **Mobile devs** - Swift (iOS), Kotlin (Android)
- **Bot developers** - Port your bots, help refine the SDK
- **Security researchers** - Audit E2EE implementation, find vulnerabilities
- **Community builders** - Spread the word, help communities migrate
- **Documentation writers** - Guides, tutorials, API docs

**Can't code?**
- Star the repos - visibility matters
- Share with communities being forced off Discord
- Test alpha releases
- Report bugs, suggest features

## Repositories

- **[intent](https://github.com/IntentAi/intent)** - Project hub and documentation
- **[intent-protocol](https://github.com/IntentAi/intent-protocol)** - Protocol specification
- **[intent-clients](https://github.com/IntentAi/intent-clients)** - Desktop, web, mobile clients
- **[intent.js](https://github.com/IntentAi/intent.js)** - JavaScript/TypeScript bot SDK
- **[intent.py](https://github.com/IntentAi/intent.py)** - Python bot SDK
- **[intent-migrate](https://github.com/IntentAi/intent-migrate)** - Discord migration toolkit

Server backend is proprietary (enables monetization via managed hosting). Clients, SDKs, and protocol specs are open source (MIT).

## What We're NOT Doing

- Collecting government IDs
- Scanning faces for biometric data
- Selling user data to advertisers
- Building surveillance infrastructure disguised as safety features
- Forcing users into walled gardens
- Bloating with features nobody asked for

**Privacy isn't a premium feature. It's the baseline.**

## License

Clients, SDKs, and protocol: **MIT License**

Server backend: **Proprietary** (enables sustainable development through managed hosting)

## Get Started

**Star the repos. Watch for releases. Contribute if you can.**

When the platform you rely on demands government IDs, you have two choices: comply or leave.

**We're building the third option: own it yourself.**

Discord doesn't get to own private communication. Not anymore.
